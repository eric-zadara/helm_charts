# Prerequisites:
# - Phase 1: Inference Extension CRDs (InferencePool, InferenceModel) must be installed
# - Phase 4: Envoy Gateway with GatewayClass 'llm-gateway' must be deployed
# - Phase 5: Model serving with InferencePool targets must be configured
#
# This chart does NOT include subchart dependencies. It reuses the Envoy Gateway
# controller deployed in Phase 4 by referencing the same GatewayClass. The internal
# Gateway resource triggers the controller to create a separate Envoy proxy instance.
