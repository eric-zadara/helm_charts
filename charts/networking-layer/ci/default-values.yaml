# CI test values for networking-layer chart
# Minimal overlay on production defaults -- only override what differs for CI.
# Prerequisites: tier1-crds (Gateway API, Knative CRDs), cert-manager

# Kourier - use production default (enabled)
# K8s 1.32+ requirement is satisfied by all CI K8s versions (1.33.7+)
# Reduce replicas to 1 for CI (production defaults are 2 for HA)
kourier:
  controller:
    replicas: 1
  gateway:
    replicas: 1

# TLS - disabled (requires hostname configuration not available in CI)
tls:
  enabled: false

# Knative ConfigMaps - DISABLED
# Requires Knative Serving operator for reconciliation.
# The operator is not included in inference-operators (only CRDs are installed).
# TODO(operators): Add Knative Serving operator to inference-operators chart,
#   then remove this override to test with production defaults.
